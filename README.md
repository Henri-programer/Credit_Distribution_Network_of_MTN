In this project, I aim to show the importance of data visualization. So, I try to represent the credit distribution data of MTN-Benin in the form of Network (or graph). 
Some credit transfers are banned by the company. I claim that depending on the network layout, a visualization of the graph can reveal fraudulent credit transactions.
